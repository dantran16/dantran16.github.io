	      <p> Pinterest is a unique social media app that shows images to preview content of other sites. It is used to find inspiration for ideas, such as finding tacky fashion trends or getting ideas to draw something. The feed layout is visually appealing and useful because it helps users quickly glance at ideas that they want. Once they find an idea they like, they can save it as a “pin” and save it into a “board”. This concept enables users to keep a collection of inspirations and ideas that can be referred to later for work, hobbies, or other things. </p>
	      <p> We chose Pinterest because we liked how different Pinterest was to other social media apps and wanted to challenge ourselves in doing a redesign of a popular app. 
          </p>
		  <p> In one course of interaction design, I worked with three other people to redesign the search component of Pinterest. In this project, we learned how to create prototypes that utilized a redesigned component as an attempt to solve user problems we noticed from the original app with the analysis of user testing and competitors. We redesigned the search component because we noticed that users ignored some of the features and that there are some features that are not needed. Although we did changes, it ultimately came back to users preferring the original component.
          </p>
		  <p> I was primarily responsible for the component redesign and competitor analysis. I was also primarily responsible for the user testing plan for the prototypes. Additionally, I also interviewed and took notes for some of the users I also chimed in ideas for the sketches and made sure the high-fidelity prototypes were functional.
          </p>

		  <h3 align="center"> User Testing - Pinterest </h3>
	      <p> In the user testing process, we found five users, who are acquaintances of our group and are primarily college students. We had a good mix of users in regards to familiarity with Pinterest. A majority of our users had minimal interaction with Pinterest, while one of them was familiar with it. For every user we tested, we had an observer and a guide. Our guide asks the users questions to answer and gives tasks for users to do. Our observer takes notes on any confusion that a user might have while they are doing tasks. 
          </p>
	      <p> We made a group of questions and tasks in order for users to navigate Pinterest’s mobile site. Some of these questions and tasks included:
          </p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li> A person’s familiarity with the app (e.g. Do you use Pinterest?)</li>
			<li> Using the app (e.g. Can you get ideas for drawing anything you’re interested in?)</li>
			<li> Impression of Pinterest (e.g. What is the purpose of pinterest?)</li>
		  </ul>
		  <p> Based on our five users, we found that users didn’t have that much trouble navigating the website. Users had no trouble going to where they needed to go and endless scrolling didn’t frustrate them. Most users knew how to create boards and saved pins.
		  </p>
		  <p> However, there were also problems that users came across. First, they were unfamiliar with some features because they were hard to find. Some users couldn’t easily figure out how to create notes, edit pins, or move boards. Second, the overall layout can be overwhelming and can lead to information overload. Ultimately, it means some features are getting ignored. Some users ignored the tabs and mostly used search for their needs. The user familiar with the app used the “For you” tab for inspiration. In the search component, all of the users exclusively used the search bar to look up things and ignored many of its other features.
